There are 5 ways to access HTML elements in the DOM through JavaScript.
--> document.getElementById()
    This method returns directly the element.

--> document.getElementsByClassName()
    This method returns an array of the elements which match the class name.
    If we want to select any individual element from this array, 
    we have to specify its index i.e. 0 or 1 etc.

--> document.getElementsByTagName()
    This method searches for the given Tag's name in the HTML document.
    It also returns an array same as that of Class Name.

--> document.querySelector()
    This method returns the direct element from the HTML code.
    It requires us to give the class name with a (. dot) at the beginning
    If its an ID, then a (# hash) at the beginning.
    If there are many such selected elements, then this method selects only
    the First element in the HTML code.

--> document.querySelectorAll()
    This method works the same way as Query Selector, but it returns an array of 
    all the elements which match the given class or ID.
    If we want to select a specific element, then we have to give Index.

These were the 5 ways to fetch an element from the DOM, after this we can do any 
operation with it.
