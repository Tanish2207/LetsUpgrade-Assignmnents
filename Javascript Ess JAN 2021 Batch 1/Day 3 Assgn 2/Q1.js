// The length property of JS Arrays gives us the total
// no. elements in the array. But here, we are specifying that 
// the length of the array is 0, it means that we are telling that 
// there are 0 elements in the array. Hence the array becomes empty.

// Therefore, the index 1 of clothes array is UNDEFINED.
